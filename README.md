# React | React Landing Page

## Introduction

We just learned the basics about creating a **Hello World** app in React, so we will use this exercise to re-do what we just learned (and hopefully to add some style :blossom: ).

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

### Iteration 1 | Initial set up

Let's start with the basics: 
- `public` folder is already there and it has some images in it.
- `src` folder contains all the javascript code of our application.
- `package.json` file contains all application dependencies (`react^17.0.1 react-dom:^17.0.1`) and running scripts (`npm run start`)

In your terminal run `npm run start` and check in your brwoser at http://localhost:3000 de default react home page.

## Iteration 2 | First Landing Page

Finally, let's create our landing page typing all JSX code in the `src/App.js` component and include your custom styles at `src/App.css`.
Remember, in the `public` folder, you will find all the assets you need to recreate the following landing page:

For now, don't worry about creating more than one component, we will cover that in the following lessons!

Happy coding! :heart:
